Hello this is a story about Shorya

Once upon time, Shorya woke up in a random basement. 
When he got up, he realized that his backpack was holding him hostage...
Shorya quickly realized that he needed to figure out how to escape from the basement and free himself from his backpack. He looked around the room and noticed a door on the other side of the room. He tried to open it, but it was locked. He then noticed a small window near the ceiling that was just big enough for him to crawl through.

Shorya carefully made his way over to the window and climbed up to it. He managed to squeeze through the window and found himself outside in a bustling city. He was relieved to be free, but now he had to figure out where he was and how to get home.

As Shorya walked around the city, he saw many people going about their day. He asked them for directions, but they didn't seem to understand him. He realized that he must be in a different city than the one he was from.

Feeling lost and confused, Shorya continued to walk around the city. He eventually came across a library and decided to go inside to see if he could find a map or some other information that would help him.

Inside the library, Shorya found a kind librarian who was able to help him. She showed him a map of the city and helped him figure out where he was and how to get back to his own city.

With the librarian's help, Shorya was able to find his way back home. He was relieved to be back in familiar surroundings and grateful to the librarian for her help. From then on, he was always careful to keep track of where he was and to never let himself get lost again.
