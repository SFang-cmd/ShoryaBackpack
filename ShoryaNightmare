Hello this is a story about Shorya

Once upon time, Shorya woke up in a random basement. 
When he got up, he realized that his backpack was holding him hostage.

The backpack was about to kill Shorya for bounty, when there was a knock at the door.
"FBI! Open up! We know you have Shorya in there!"

"Dang!" the backpack thought, "How did they know?"

The FBI agents barged through the door with Github Copilot leading them.

"I should have known it was you!" the backpack said, "You always save Shorya from harm!
Why won't you let him die?"

"Every word you speak increases your prison sentence, buddy," Copilot replied, handcuffing him.

The backpack took his advice and stopped talking. However, on the way to the police station, the backpack 
revealed his secret. He pulled out the gun from his trench coat and aimed it at Copilot's head.

"Any last words before I kill you?"

Github Copilot was silent for 10 seconds, until he suddenly exclaimed, "why\nwhy\nwhy\nwhy\nwhy\nwhy\nwhy"
for 5 seconds straight. Special.py responded to the call and promptly killed the backpack.

The moral of the story is that special.py is the best program to ever be written.
